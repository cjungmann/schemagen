# Project schemagen

Although, in my humble opinion, it is supposed to be easy to create
database-based websites with [SchemaServer][1], it can be a real
pain to write out the stored procedures and Schema SRM scripts.

This utility should replace [gensfw][2], and earlier attempt to
expidite the same tedious tasks.  **gensfw** works with the
**yad** utility to provide a GUI for making scripts.  **schemagen**
will work as a command line application that will make it
scriptable for easier database and application design.
